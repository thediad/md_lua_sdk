# Mega Drive Lua SDK (mdlua)

## Current development branch

Start with the **[development guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)** for the current
Windows workflow, project configuration, working features and limits.
The **[development changelog](CHANGELOG.md)** tracks ongoing changes.
The **[release checklist](docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md)** tracks standalone-release
readiness. This branch is local development work; the npm badge below does not
mean these changes are in the published package.

From this SDK checkout: `npm.cmd run build -- examples/hello/main.lua`.
For a project, put source/output/assets in `mdlua.json`; a linked CLI can then
build it with `mdlua.cmd build`. The prepared workstation starter also has a
one-command `build.cmd`. No manual Windows preload setup is needed with these
entry points. The guide documents the local compiler dependency and setup.

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/mdlua.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdlua)

Make games for the **Sega Mega Drive / Genesis** by writing a
**PICO-8-flavored Lua** instead of C or 68000 assembly.

The SDK **ahead-of-time compiles** your Lua to C, builds it with a bundled m68k
toolchain against an SGDK runtime, and produces a Genesis `.bin` ROM. This branch
is tested with Genesis Plus GX and BlastEm; physical hardware validation is
deferred. No interpreter, no VM: your
Lua becomes native 68000 machine code.

If you know PICO-8 you'll feel at home (`spr`/`btn`/`_init`/`_update`/`_draw`,
Lua syntax) - but this SDK leans into what the Genesis can do that a fantasy
console can't: **80 hardware sprites, two free-scrolling tile planes plus a
window-plane HUD, LIVE `pal()` (real palette RAM), per-scanline raster
scroll, shadow/highlight, whole-screen palette fades, YM2612 FM music + PCM
sound effects, battery saves, and a real second controller.** Familiarity,
not compatibility.

mdlua is the third SDK in a family that shares one compiler front-end and
number model: [gtlua](https://github.com/monteslu/gametank_lua_sdk) targets
the GameTank (6502), gbalua the Game Boy Advance (ARM), and mdlua the
Genesis (68000).

## Your first game

The whole hello, one `main.lua` with no asset files: a greeting plus a hardware
sprite you move with the d-pad. `_update60` runs movement once per game loop;
`_draw` redraws the sprite every frame (`examples/hello/main.lua`):

```lua
-- The screen is 320x224. spr uses the built-in default sheet, so no art file
-- is needed. Colors are PICO-8-style indices 0-15 (1 dark-blue, 14 pink).
local x, y = 152, 104

function _update60()               -- input + movement each game loop
  if (btn(1)) then x += 2 end      -- right
  if (btn(0)) then x -= 2 end      -- left
  if (btn(3)) then y += 2 end      -- down
  if (btn(2)) then y -= 2 end      -- up
end

function _draw()
  cls(1)                              -- dark-blue background plane
  print("hello genesis", 116, 32, 14) -- greeting near the top, pink
  spr(0, x, y, 2, 2)                  -- the hardware sprite, redrawn every frame
end
```

</p>

Build it to a ROM and run it:

```powershell
node bin/mdlua-launch.mjs build --project examples/hello/mdlua.json
node bin/mdlua-launch.mjs run examples/hello/build/hello.bin
```

`mdlua run` opens an emulator window (bundled Genesis Plus GX core): arrows =
d-pad, `Z`/`X`/`C` = the A/B/C buttons, Enter = START. The same `.bin` runs
in BlastEm. That's the development loop: write
`main.lua`, build the `.bin`, ship it.

## Featured example: a full shmup

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monteslu/md_lua_sdk/main/examples/starfall/screenshot.png" width="640" alt="the starfall shmup: a player ship firing at a formation of alien sprites over a starfield, with a score/lives HUD, on the Genesis">
</p>

[`examples/starfall`](examples/starfall) is a complete little shmup - hardware
sprites, a scrolling starfield, demo music and PSG effects, a HUD, win/lose states - in one
`main.lua`. That's what this SDK is for:

```powershell
node bin/mdlua-launch.mjs build --project examples/starfall/mdlua.json
node bin/mdlua-launch.mjs run examples/starfall/build/starfall.bin
```

These commands run from the SDK checkout. Open the resulting ROM in BlastEm
if the optional SDL runner is unavailable. See the
[Starfall instructions](examples/starfall/README.md) for controls and audio assets.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) **24+**
- This development branch requires the sibling canonical `luacretro` checkout
  through `file:../../luacretro`; see the [setup guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md).
  A standalone distributable compiler pin is still pending.
- `npm install` brings the remaining toolchain dependencies as published
  packages: m68k-gcc + SGDK + the XGM2 sound driver, all **as WebAssembly**
  (via [`romdev-toolchain-m68k-gcc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/romdev-toolchain-m68k-gcc),
  pinned). No SGDK install, no cross-compiler to build, no native tools.

The build runs the WASM toolchain in-process (`cc1-m68k` → `as` → `ld` →
`objcopy`), pads the ROM, and writes the header checksum strict loaders
demand. `mdlua run` plays the ROM in a window over the bundled
[`romdev-core-gpgx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/romdev-core-gpgx) core,
through [`romdev-core-runner`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/romdev-core-runner)
- the one SDL host shared across the SDK family and the romdev playtest tool.
The window needs `@kmamal/sdl` (an *optional* dependency of the runner); without
it, build the `.bin` and run it in any Genesis emulator.

## The screen and the two draw paths

The screen is **320×224**. Two ways to draw; sprites and sound compose over
both.

- **Sprites + tile planes** - the real game path. `spr()` is a hardware
  sprite (80 per frame), `map_show()` puts your tilemap on a hardware plane,
  and `camera()` scrolls it for free. This is what the flagship example
  (`starfall`) uses.
- **Bitmap verbs** - immediate `pset`/`rect`/`circ`/`line` into a 256×160
  software framebuffer (the SGDK BMP engine, lazy-initialized, ~41 KB of the
  64 KB work RAM). Useful for pixel drawing and effects. Hello above uses
  hardware sprites; the bitmap engine has a separate memory and timing budget.

## The PICO-8 contract

Define `_update60()` plus `_draw()`, and optionally `_init()`. The runtime
latches input before each update and ends the frame after `_draw()` (sprite
list + palette flush as queued DMA at vblank).

**Numbers use 16.16 fixed point**. `sin`/`cos`/`atan2` use
turns (0..1) with PICO-8's screen-space-inverted sin. The compiler keeps
values that stay integral in 32-bit ints. Do not rely on overflow matching
PICO-8; see the [numeric behavior reference](docs/NUMERIC_BEHAVIOR.md).

**The dialect** keeps PICO-8's syntax: `+=`-style compound assignment,
one-line `if (cond) stmt` / `while (cond) stmt`, `!=`, `\` floor division,
`//` comments, hex/binary literals with fractions, and multiple assignment
(`x, y = 64, 32`).

**Arrays are 1-indexed** (Lua/PICO-8 style): `a = array(8)`, then `a[1]` is
the first element.

signatures and the honest limits.

## The Genesis flavor

Direct SGDK calls are an advanced interface. Generated descriptors establish
which calls the compiler accepts, not runtime verification of every API. The
[development guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) distinguishes tested behavior from
availability; callers managing SGDK resources directly must respect the SDK's
VRAM, palette, sprite and audio ownership.

The reason this target is fun:

- **`pal()` is real.** CRAM is writable at runtime, so palette cycling,
  hit-flashes, and day/night are one call - the thing PICO-8 carts always
  faked. All palette traffic rides a shadow flushed as one DMA per frame
  (mid-frame CRAM writes race the VDP; the runtime already learned that
  lesson so you don't have to).
- **`hscroll(line, x)`** sets the map plane's horizontal scroll per scanline
  - wavy water, heat shimmer, split-screen parallax. 224 lines, one DMA.
- **FM music.** `music(n)` plays song n from your `--music` bank through the
  XGM2 driver on the Z80 - the sound of the platform. `music(-1)` stops,
  `music(n, false)` plays once. `sfx(n)` fires PCM samples from your `--sfx`
  bank OVER the music (PSG tone fallback so you hear something before assets
  exist; a built-in demo tune answers `music()` before you add songs).
- **`hud(rows)`** claims the VDP's third plane as an unscrollable status bar;
  `print` routes into it automatically.
- **Two players are real**: `btn(i, 1)` reads the second pad.

## Assets

For declared sprite sizes, see [pre-scaled sprites](docs/PRESCALED_SPRITES.md).
`--sprite-variants variants.json` generates palette-preserving variants from
`--sheet`, reports their memory cost, and draws each with one hardware sprite.
`--gff sprites.gff` imports exactly 256 raw sprite-flag bytes, compatible with
GameTank's flag assets, for `fget`, `fset`, and PICO map layer filtering.
See [PICO_RUNTIME.md](docs/PICO_RUNTIME.md) for the format and an example.

`--sheet sprites.png` imports a sprite sheet (8×8 cells, row-major, up to 15
opaque colors + transparent), `--map level.png` a tilemap (deduped tiles),
via a self-contained PNG → VDP-tile converter (`compiler/png-tiles.mjs`).
`--sfx a.wav,b.wav` builds the PCM sample bank (converted to the XGM2
contract: 8-bit signed 13.3 kHz, 256-byte aligned).
`--music intro.vgm,level.vgm` builds the song bank - bank order is the
`music(n)` index. `.vgm` comes from any Mega Drive tracker (DefleMask,
Furnace: export VGM); gzipped `.vgz` and precompiled `.xgc` work too. The
VGM → XGM2 conversion is byte-identical to SGDK's own xgm2tool.

```sh
mdlua build mygame/main.lua \
  --sheet mygame/sprites.png --map mygame/level.png \
  --sfx mygame/laser.wav --music mygame/theme.vgm -o mygame/game.bin
```

`mdlua c main.lua` prints the generated C for debugging.

The `examples/` directory shows each subsystem in use:

| example | shows |
|---|---|
| `hello` | shapes + text, no assets - the smallest cart |
| `mvp` | a sheet, animated + flipped sprites, text colors, input |
| `anim` | the frame-range animation helpers (loop / ping-pong / once) |
| `raster` | the Genesis showcase: `hscroll` waves + live `pal()` cycling + window HUD + FM |
| `platformer` | tiles + sprites + gravity/jump - the genre starter |
| `starfall` | a complete shmup - scrolling tile plane, sprites, HUD, music |
| `music` | the `--music` song bank: switch / stop / play-once / sfx over music |
| `pcm` | raw PCM through SGDK's standalone `SND_PCM` driver |
| `sgdk_direct` | raw SGDK calls (`VDP_*`, `PAL_*`) mixed with PICO-8 verbs |
| `coroutine` | an SGDK user task (`TSK_userSet`) running a Lua function |
| `vint_callback` | a Lua function as the vblank interrupt hook |
| `sprite_callback` | the SGDK sprite engine calling back into Lua |

## Not-Lua walls (loud, never silent)

Conditions must be boolean (`if x ~= 0 then`, not `if x then` - Lua calls 0
truthy, C doesn't, and the compiler refuses to guess). No `nil`, closures,
metatables, Lua coroutines, runtime string concatenation, or `goto` (SGDK's 68k
task API - `TSK_userSet` and friends - covers the background-work use case
natively; see `examples/coroutine`). Every unsupported feature is a
compile-time error that says what to write instead.

## Repo layout

`compiler/` the Lua→C compiler + the Genesis build driver (`build-md.mjs`)
and PNG importer (`png-tiles.mjs`) · `md-sdk/` the C runtime (thin SGDK
wrappers: `md_api.c` frame + sprites + planes + palette + text + sound,
`md_anim.c`, `md_math.c` the 16.16 math) · `bin/mdlua.js` CLI +
`bin/mdlua-run.mjs` the emulator window · `examples/` · `test/`.
